class CustomTypeEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
    """
    A custom JSONEncoder class that knows how to encode core custom
    objects.

    Custom objects are encoded as JSON object literals (ie, dicts) with
    one key, 'TypeName' where 'TypeName' is the actual name of the
    type to which the object belongs.  That single key maps to another
    object literal which is just the __dict__ of the object encoded.

    Reason for ignoring the error:
    E0202 - An attribute affected in json.encoder line 157 hide this method
    reported by pylint:

    The error is in json.encoder.JSONEncoder class.
    There is a default method (which is overridden here) and also a class
    attribute self.default initialized in the init method of the class.
    The intention of such usage being that a custom default method object can
    be passed to init when creating an instance of JSONEncoder, which is then
    assigned to class's default method. (which is valid)
    But pylint raises an issue due to the usage of same name for a method and
    an attribute in which case the attribute definition hides the method.
    The reason and example for the issue: (top rated comment)
